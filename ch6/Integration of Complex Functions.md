# Definition (Complex Integration)
Let $f: [a,b] \to \C$ be a bounded [[Complex Numbers|complex]] function. Since $f$ is complex, then $f(x) = u(x) + i \cdot v(x)$ where $u,v$ are real functions. Then we say that $f$ is [[Riemann-Stieltjes Integral|Riemann Integrable]] if and only if $u,v$ are integrable. We write
$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = \int_{a}^{b} u(x) dx + i \int_{a}^{b} v(x) dx
$$
