# Theorem (L'Hopital's Rule)
Suppose $f,g$ are real and differentiable in $(a,b)$ and $g'(x) \neq 0$ for all $x \in (a, b)$, where $-\infty \leq a < b \leq + \infty$. Suppose 
$$
\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} \to A \text{ as } x \to a
$$
If 
$$
f(x) \to 0 \text{ and } g(x) \to 0 \text{ as } x \to a 
$$
or if 
$$
g(x) \to \infty \text{ as } x \to a
$$
then
$$
\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \to A \text{ as } x \to a
$$
